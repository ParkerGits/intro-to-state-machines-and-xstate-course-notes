# 01. Course Intro and Overview

In this lesson, Kyle provides us with a brief introduction to and summary of his course.
By the end of this course, we should have a good understanding of the utility of State Machines and the XState library.

The code for each lesson is available in the Github link found in the lesson descriptions.
If you would like to follow along on your own, I recommend creating your own project environment by following these steps.

First, create a new project folder. Then, navigate to the folder in your terminal and run:

```
npm init
```

Follow the steps in the terminal to create a package.json.

Next, to install the XState dependency, run the following in the terminal:

```
npm install xstate
```

Finally, in your project folder, create an "index.js" file. This file will contain the lesson code for each respective lesson.

Now, we are ready to follow along with the course.
